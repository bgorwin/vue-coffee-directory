# Coffee Passport

## This personal project is aimed to solve the issue of finding quality third wave coffee shops when in selected cities. I have personally been to all that are listed in this project and have rated them based off my personal opinion. If you are in a city that is displayed, view the list of coffee shops that will provide you with the perfect cup of coffee and coffee culutre as it should be.

### I chose to code this entire project in Vue JS because I wanted to learn how to it works and can honestly say that I love it. I am utilizing Vuetify as well for the card componenets and navigation.
